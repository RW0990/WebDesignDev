    <h3>
      This website covers the UN goal number 14 on the "17 Goals to Transform
      Our World", which is Life Below Water.
    </h3>

    <h4>This goal talks about marine life, oceans and the seas</h4>

    <!-- paragraphs -->
    <p>
      We need the oceans to be clean and healthy to exist. It is the key element
      in the existance of life. Most of the earth is water 75% in fact. The
      oceans do a lot for us that we take for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It provides natural resources such as food, medicines, fuels and it aborbs
      C02 from the atmosphere. Yet, we still pollute it causing the PH to become
      more acidic. This causes significant issues for marine life like causing
      the bleaching of coral reefs and the overall loss of marine life.
    </p>

    <h4>The Ocean is the Worlds Largest Ecosystem</h4>
    <p>
      It provides more than 50% of the planets oxygen according to the Nation
      Ocean Service while also regulating climate and weather patterns.
      Therefore the ocean is absolutely key to life on Earth. We also rely on it
      massively for transporting goods and tourism industries. Not forgetting
      the fish we eat provides some of the highest protein in our diets and is
      extremely healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are vast amounts of species of marine life such as fish, coral,
      seaweed, shark, whales and the list goes on we are still discovering new
      unseen species in the depths of the deepest oceans around the globe.
    </p>

    <h4>The Rising Temperature</h4>
    <p>
      Due to the rising ocean temperature of the earth and its oceans due the
      human impact is becoming a serious issue. The SDG report shows the
      scenarios for temperature, if the ocean temperature rises by 1.5 degrees
      70-90% of coral reefs will be gone. If it rises by 2 degres they will die
      off completely. If you wish to see these statistics, visit
