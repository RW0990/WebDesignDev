  <h3>How are we causing this?</h3>
  <h4>How it began..</h4>
  <p>
    As humans we invented countless amazing machines a lot of them use fossil fuels to run these. During the industrial revolution around 1750 engines a new invention which burnt coal produced masses of smoke and harmful emissions. These include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates, carbon dioxide (CO2), mercury, and other heavy metals. This caused a lot of smog and these harmful gases were being released into the atmosphere. It started us on the path to climate change. The oceans were affected substantially. The release of large quantities of C02 emissions turned the oceans more acidic. The PH rose this causes issues for marine life it makes it harder to grow shells or skeletons. The increase of acidity was a staggering 30%!

  <h4>Fuels</h4>
  <p>
    A lot of fuels are found under the sea and we mine them. According to EBSCO "Oil wells have been drilled in the ocean for more than one hundred years, and during that time, marine oil and gas production has grown so rapidly that by the twenty-first century, over 30 percent of the world's oil and 28 percent of the world's natural gas came from below the seafloor." This causes destruction of habitats, different species and water pollution as well as distruption to the natural environment. Sediment plumes are released causing issues for underwater animals decreasing reproduction rates. It releases more carbon into the ocean driving up the acidity. This all causes global warming and drives ocean temperatures up further. This causes irreversible damage.
